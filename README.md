# Custom Items for Forge 1.8.9
This mod aims to patch Optifine's Custom Item module to make it more optimized in high-load scenarios.

## Why?
Optifine's approach is not optimal for large-scale maps and resource packs. Optifine scans NBT data for every item every frame, without features like caching, causing huge framerate drops when entities exceed the expected amount.

## Compatibility
This mod is compatible with the newest version of Optifine for 1.8.9.

## Is this safe?
The mod is 100% open source, you can download it, look through the code and even build the mod yourself.
